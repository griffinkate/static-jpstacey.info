<ul><li>Wordpress isn't actually better than Drupal</li>
<li>Because you can't compare Wordpress and Drupal</li>
<li>So the usability issues arise from a false comparison</li>
<li>And here's what's going to solve our problems instead</li>
</ul><p>In the first paragraph or two it managed to simultaneously both praise Jen's talk and completely deny the core message of it. I think that highlights a number of trends in the way that the Drupal community as an aggregate (though by no means as a whole) tends to think about usability versus technology. Actually, I think the communities behind most large open-source projects behave this way, and it's ones like Wordpress or Ubuntu that are actually unusual. But I think it's worth talking about this phenomenon in the context of Drupal.</p>
<h2>Apples and oranges</h2>
<p>Anyone who argues a point of view can be sure they've ruffled some feathers, when someone else complains that they're "comparing apples and oranges." It's a definite sign that the complainer doesn't like the problem that's been raised, and instead wants to treat an informal analogy as if it were a keystone in a tense, logical structure; then attack the analogy instead. It's like <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/uk.rec.cycling/browse_thread/thread/fe1f27680d625a2b/10d9d5a6b1d693de#10d9d5a6b1d693de">hurling around cries of "ad hominem"</a>. It doesn't really prove or solve anything. Apart from anything else, what if my <em>point</em> is to compare apples with oranges?</p>
<p>Whatever you compare Drupal to, whatever your motives, whatever important (often fundamental) issues you want to highlight about the way Drupal does things... eventually you'll have to compare Drupal to <em>something that isn't Drupal</em>. You will have to compare the apple to some other fruit. That's the only comparison worth making. Are we just going to forever compare Drupal 5 to Drupal 4.7, Drupal 6 to Drupal 5, and gradually Drupal 7 to Drupal 6, purely as a teleological exercise in patting ourselves on the back? Of course not! And however close the <em>something else</em> might be to being Drupal, there'll be some slight difference, which will inevitably provide an opportunity for hairsplitting. Maybe we could call it fruitsplitting instead, because that difference in variety of fruit can be used as an excuse, if not a reason, to dismiss your broader motivations in making the comparison.</p>
<p>"X isn't a CMS." "Y isn't in PHP." "Z isn't <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/130467/how-does-aop-work-in-drupal">aspect-oriented programming</a>." "P is aspect-oriented programming, but it's intended to be purer than Drupal, with pointcuts." "Q doesn't have a genial tousle-headed giant as its benevolent dictator."</p>
<p>Apples aren't oranges, but then some apples aren't the same as other apples, either. Apples come in all sorts of varieties. So you can even compare apples with apples, if you like, and someone will come along and protest. Except they won't so often these days. Want to know why? Well, <a href="http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2004/10/30/fallen-fruit/">here's a story about apples, from the ever-readable George Monbiot</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly: there used to be a huge market in different apple varieties. Hundreds and hundreds of varieties: Belle de Boskoop, Michaelmas Red, Brown Cockle. And then the supermarkets came along, and they decided that they could essentially compel their customers to standardize on a handful of apple types: Royal Gala, Jazz, Cox's. They did it, because the customer didn't really mind what type of fruit he was eating.</p>
<p>And that was essentially the end of the line for most types of apples. "Extinct, extinct, extinct." Most of them just gone. The free market effectively wiped out those varieties, ruthlessly and ignorantly. It reduced the number of breeds to a tiny fraction of what it was. People compared apples with other, different apples, and they just picked... apples. Nobody will fruitsplit between apple varieties now, because they're just all apples.</p>
<p>Drupal already has plenty of greengrocers, fruiterers of the programming world, people who rightfully and meticulously care about, and tend with love to, our apples and our oranges. But the prize, the broad user base, the real success story... that all lies in attracting non-greengrocers. And they'll just think: "Apples. Oranges. Other apples. Whatever." They probably won't care about different types of fruit; they've been told that their website has to have its vitamin C for the day, so they'll get the apple that's easier to get into, and to hell with your awkward-to-peel oranges. If your business model depends on selling individually wrapped fruit to other greengrocers, then good luck with that. I'm off to take some coals to Newcastle.</p>
<h2>Who's going to tell the customers?</h2>
<p>The blogpost suggests that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Instead of comparing a toolset and a product, there are other, appropriate comparisons that businesses and developers should be making...</p>
<p>Well, it's wonderful that I know that now. But who's going to tell everyone <em>else </em>to change their ways? Is there going to be some sort of government-funded outreach programme? Will we all be making some sort of world tour? I try to picture a random drupal.org user appearing, like a superhero in a flash, in offices around the globe. "Hark! I hear someone in Mumbai making comparisons between Wordpress and Drupal that appear reasonably valid to them based on their expectations derived from: Drupal websites, Wordpress websites, drupal.org and wordpress.org. Yet I must intervene, swiftly! To the nearest train station!"</p>
<p>Anyone who decides that the solution is to tell businesses and developers what comparisons are appropriate will end up like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_characters#Wowbagger.2C_the_Infinitely_Prolonged">Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged</a>, travelling in time so that they can tackle simultaneous disparagements of Drupal. We can't rely on that: Drupal ultimately has to be able to say this <em>for itself</em>: it should be obvious to these businesses and developers what Drupal should be compared to. Otherwise these businesses and developers will continue to make comparisons based on the (admittedly incomplete and sometimes wrong) information they have available to them. </p>
<p>Saying what comparisons end users ought to be making is a lot like that other canard, "educating the user." Unless you're talking about a site's administrative user base, people at a client who you could count on one hand, that's a pretty mammoth task. Who gets to ensure that such universal education about the vagaries of, say, module weights, or the vagaries of CCK field display, eradicates doubt in the same way that we once got rid of smallpox? Similarly, if Drupal's success against Wordpress depends on people only ever making the comparisons we want them to make, we're in trouble.</p>
<p>There's also tendency to call Drupal a CMS, right up to the point where someone complains it can't do what a CMS does out of the box. Then it's called something else. A toolset. A content management framework. A management framework toolkit. A content toolkit framework management system tool. It might deflect debate, but ultimately the jargon just puts people off. You might have won the battle with potential new users, but the war goes to whichever CMS with limitations that accepts from the outset that it's a CMS with limitations, and tackles those limitations---in Drupal's case, most notabbly user experience and getting started with it if you've never heard of Drupal before---head on.</p>
<p>The documentation on Drupal.org is pretty impenetrable to the average newbie, but if you can figure it out then you get the impression that Drupal is basically a CMS, a bit like Wordpress only with other (waves hands) stuff. So it must have a WYSIWYG editor, only somehow more so, right...? And the user experience of Drupal 7 is a great improvement, much like improvements that have already happened in Wordpress; but, despite <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0-beta1">the fantastic news that we're moving to beta releases</a>, only greengrocers are using that right now. If we want non-Drupal users to make the right comparisons about Drupal, <em>today</em>, will we really fix it by arguing about distributions; products; toolsets; downloads; projects; modules; features...?</p>
<h2>The technology will save us, of course</h2>
<p>Here's a handy tip. Technology alone will probably never save you. You only have to have sat through Jen's talk, and to have read about Hagen's similar Wordpress-Drupal-Joomla walkthroughs in the unconference on DrupalCon Monday (I blogged about <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/89429">Hagen's marvellously excruciating walkthroughs on the g.d.o usability group</a>) to know that the technology won't save us. Or rather, specific bits won't save us. Aegir won't save us. Products won't save us. Distributions won't save us. The drupal.org redesign probably won't save us either, because that's nearly finished and yet we're still denying the very usability and expectation problems that are still in plain sight.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. All of these things are great tech--really fantastic, mindblowing tech---and they solve specific problems that developers come across. I think drush make is one of the most exciting bits of Drupal I've ever used. But I'm a developer! Of course I will think that! Not only do I know how to set a Drupal site up in 15 minutes, but I also know from experience how to avoid the many, many ways in which it will take you two days. These tools  don't fix the fact that Wordpress is easy to use. Wordpress just works. Drupal needs tools to help you install it, and command-line fu before you can even make those damn upgrade errors go away, go away, please just go away.</p>
<p><em>You can't wait for technology to solve these things</em>. Distributions won't change the fact that you can click around the drupal.org website for ten minutes and still not be completely sure what it is, or how to use it. The learning curve is still too large; and I'm just talking about how you use drupal.org, not how you use Drupal. Until everyone in the world is re-educated to know, and care, about what a distribution is, and how it's subtly different from just getting the blasted thing to work, then distributions won't save us.</p>
<p>What will save us is usability. User experience reviews. Jen Lampton's talk. Hagen Graf's talk. Watching users try to get to grips with this thing we love, when they just don't love it so much, won't excuse it as much. Feeling the cringe when a new user falls into the same trap over and over again, and knowing you won't be able to appear on their shoulder to help them. Then, though: this is key. You can't just say, "well, we'll let the themers fix that," or "maybe the forums can discuss it," or even: "<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/83924#comment-261554">when users ask for the wrong thing it is rarely, if ever, the right answer to humor them.</a>" Instead, you have to accept the application has a usability problem; and work out a plan fix it, right there and then. Developers, deciding to fixing usability problems above functionality problems. Again and again and again. Test, observe, cringe, fix, repeat.</p>
<p>It's a slog. But it could work where technology won't, because ultimately end-user functionality with serious usability problems will end up massively underused, and as far as the greater course of Drupal is concerned it might as well not be written.</p>
<h2>Does this matter?</h2>
<p>I feel like I've gone on a bit, and if you feel like that too then I apologise. After all, the usability community in Drupal is healthy and growing. People are starting to take usability seriously. But I feel like there's still no UX standards to point to, with the same weight and depth as the coding standards. Talk is silver; code is gold; UX is presumably 24-carat meh. There are still no easy ways of sharing usable interface patterns as easily as one might share patches. Usability is still a teenager, and it's easy to freeze it out of the conversation it in favour of adults talking about established technical preferences. Usability needs cultivating, and the user's behaviour needs to be king, whatever comparisons that user might make. We're right to worry about Wordpress, but that's a good sign! It means that Drupal is doing something right. It's worrying about the user.</p>
<p>Maybe, returning to the original blogpost, "the time is right for Drupal products." I'm happy to agree with that. Featurization and ease of deployment certainly suggest that productization will swiftly follow. But that has nothing whatsoever to do with the usability talks. It really won't solve the fundamental problems that Jen's talk tried to address.</p>
<p>One thing she said really stuck with me; as a developer, I took note. Well, <a href="/blog/2010/09/01/thursday-1-jennifer-lea-lampton-wordpress-better-drupal.html">I took lots of notes</a>, but here's what stood out for me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Wordpress is behind us, but they can move fast, and they're looking at us."</p>
<p>With version 3.0, Wordpress quietly turned itself into a CMS. Maybe they saw fields were working well for Drupal, and thought: we'll have that. "It's simple but it'll do: let's ship!" Bang. Instant easy CMS. Usable too.</p>
<p>That's the point, in the end. Usability is not a nice-to-have. It's the canary in the cage, the indicator species: when usability suffers, it's telling you about lots of other attitudes that lead to the user being made unhappy. Whereas Wordpress emphasizes <em>usability</em>; it's friendly to the user out of the box; with things rich-text editing that the user wants to have without any issues; with straightforward media management; and with upgrade methods so simple they're frightening.</p>
<p>Drupal? Drupal's a brilliant, smart, well-oiled, massively functional framework (it's far more fun to <em>develop</em> with than Wordpress.) It's a CMS, except when it's not (but when it's not, it's still a rich seam for <em>developers</em> to mine.) It's still tricky for newbies to install (but <em>developers</em> learn the tricks.) Image handling is odd, and if you pick the wrong method early on you're in for a lot of pain later (but <em>developers </em>know which one to pick.) Upgrading modules is <em>not</em> a one-click experience (unless you're a <em>developer </em>and you've played with drush.)</p>
<p>Yet with all that in mind, here's a question. If you'd never heard of Drupal or Wordpress before, and you were 90% of the internet, rather than a <em>developer; </em>if you were the same sort of user as a client's marketing guy, who's never written a line of PHP in his life; based on the experience of trying to get each of them up and running yourself, which would you choose? Apple or orange?</p>
